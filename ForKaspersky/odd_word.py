1. OddWord

Find a string of a given length such that each letter occurs an odd number of times.

Task description
    Write a function solution that, given an integer N, returns a string consisting of N lowercase letters (aâˆ’z)
    such that each letter occurs an odd number of times. We only care about occurrences of letters that appear
    at least once in the result.
Examples:
    1. Given N = 4, the function may return "code" (each of the letters "c", "o", "d" and "e" occurs once).
        Other correct answers are: "cats", "uutu" or "xxxy".
    2. Given N = 7, the function may return "gwgtgww" ("g" and "w" occur three times each and "t" occurs once).
    3. Given N = 1, the function may return "z".
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
    N is an integer within the range [1..200,000].
