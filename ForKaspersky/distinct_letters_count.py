2. DistinctLettersCount

Count the minimum number of letters that must be deleted from a word to create a word in which
no two letters occur the same number of times.

Task description
    Write a function: def solution(S)
    that, given a string S consisting of N lowercase letters, returns the minimum number of letters that must be deleted
    to obtain a word in which every letter occurs a unique number of times. We only care about occurrences of letters
    that appear at least once in result.
Examples:
    1. Given S = "aaaabbbb", the function should return 1. We can delete one occurrence of a or one occurrence of b.
        Then one letter will occur four times and the other one three times.
    2. Given S = "ccaaffddecee", the function should return 6. For example, we can delete all occurrences of e and f
        and one occurrence of d to obtain the word "ccaadc". Note that both e and f will occur zero times in the
        new word, but that is fine, since we only care about letters that appear at least once.
    3. Given S = "eeee", the function should return 0 (there is no need to delete any characters).
    4. Given S = "example", the function should return 4.
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
    N is an integer within the range [0..300,000];
    string S consists only of lowercase letters (aâˆ’z).
